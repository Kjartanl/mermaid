# Intro to Mermaid

This repos is intended as a playground for testing and presenting diagrams and models created with Mermaid. It was created for a 10 minute lightning talk on the subject. 

For more in depth info and documentation, see [the official mermaid site](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).
 
### Why use models?

- **Clear & simple communication**
- **Focus on what is important, filter out the rest.**   

> ### "*All models are wrong, but some are useful*"
> ##### - *George Box (British statistician, 1919 - 2013)*
