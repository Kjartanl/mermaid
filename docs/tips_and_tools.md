# Tips and Tools

## Tools

### Visual Studio Code + Extensions

- Basic support for editing `.md` files (markdown)
- Various extensions, both for markdown in general, and for Mermaid in particular
  - I've beed using [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) both for creating and presenting this talk.

## Workflow

- Create Snippets! 
  - Add shortcuts in VS Code that can quickly set up a template for you to fill in or modify.
- Keep it simple!
  - Several small diagrams are often better than one or a few large ones, especially in Mermaid, where larger diagrams can sometimes feel awkward to work with. 
- Use git. Commit often. 
    - Mearmaid syntax can be confusing, and small changes can mess stuff up. It's better to cherrypick, squash & merge a bunch of commits than to risk loosing work.
