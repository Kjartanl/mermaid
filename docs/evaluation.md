 
# Advantages & Drawbacks of using Mermaid

## GOOD

 - Fairly easy to get started (assuming your're comfortable with code and / or markdown syntax).
 - Fairly quick to make simple diagrams
 - Works nicely with git 
 - Supported directly in GitHub and many other places
 - No extra tools required (or licences...)
 
 ### Bad

- Potentially confusing syntax, especially in the beginning. 
  - Not always easy to remember 
  - A single character can mess up an entire diagram
  - *Mitigating factors: You get warnings pointing to line numbers where there is an error.*
- Can be messy for bigger diagrams
- Not always easy to customize / organize elements the way you might want 
  - **Example:** ER Diagrams(1)("Entity Relationship" - Database modeling diagrams*): Limited control over how / where boxes are placed.

 > ## Takeaway: 
 > ### 1) Be selective: Find and use the parts that may benefit you & your team, and ignore the rest.
 > ### 2) Like everything else, using Mermaid gets easier the more you familiarize yourself with it.
